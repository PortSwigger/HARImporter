<p>This extension allows you to load the contents of HAR files into Burp Suite's Sitemap tool. HAR (HTTP Archive) files are used to store data about web browsers' interactions with a website. They can capture web traffic that occurs between a web browser and a site. Each HAR file is a JSON-formatted archive file that contains a log of web transactions, including but not limited to HTTP response and request headers, web page load timings, and metadata. These files can be generated from most major web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, usually from within the Developer Tools.</p>
